Hey, This is a main PCB for the work that I have done.
I would suggest you that you download the GRB files as a whole. This is what the old PCB looked like:

Since Then I have updated the PCB to add Boron and the Charging system via Solar Panel. The new PCB's look like:

# Building
The PCB can be easily assembled by attaching the [Stacking Headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2830) on the PCB for all the spots except the bottom where the Charging port will come. Since the [I2C Multiplexer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2717) is usually not likely to fail and we will never upgrade it again without changing the PCB we can solder it to the board, hence we will only need 3 packs of stacking headers per PCB if we want to make it interchangeable.

## Equipments Required.
- Solder
- Soldering iron
- Soldering Paste
- Smoke dissipator
- Electric Tape
- [Stacking Headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2830) x 3
- [I2C Multiplexer](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2717)
- [Adalogger FeatherWing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2922)
- [Adafruit Feather M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403)
- [Boron LTE CAT-M1](https://store.particle.io/products/boron-lte-cat-m1-noram-with-ethersim-4th-gen)
- [Adafruit Universal USB / DC / Solar LiPo charger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4755)

# Finished Product

This is what a finished PCB looks like:
